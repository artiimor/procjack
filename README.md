# procjack

PoC of injecting code into a running Linux process.
Spawns a new thread to host the injected code.

## Example

This will inject shellcode, contained in the [`count`](src/count.asm) binary, into a running process 'dummy'.
```
$ cd src
$ make
$ ./dummy &
$ ./inject -p $(pidof dummy) -f ./count
```

Quick-n-dirty command to verify that a process is running multiple threads
```
$ ps -eLF | head -1; ps -eLF | grep -i dummy
```
